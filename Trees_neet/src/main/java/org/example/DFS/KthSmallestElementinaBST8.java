//Let's step through the execution of the code for the input:

//Tree structure:
//markdown
//Copy code
//      3
//     / \
//    1   4
//     \
//      2
//k = 1: We need to find the smallest (1st smallest) element.
//Execution of kthSmallest(root, 1):
//The main method calls helper(root, 1) where root is the node with value 3.
//Recursive Steps
//Step 1: Start at Node 3
//Current node.val = 3.
//Perform helper(node.left, 1) (go to the left subtree).

//Step 2: Move to Node 1
//Current node.val = 1.
//Perform helper(node.left, 1) (go to the left subtree).

//Step 3: Left of Node 1 is NULL
//node == null, so return null.

//Step 4: Back to Node 1
//No node was found in the left subtree, so:
//Increment count â†’ count = 1.
//Check if (count == k):
//count == 1, so k == 1.
//Return node (Node 1).

//Step 5: Back to Node 3
//The left subtree of Node 3 returned Node 1 (the k-th smallest node).
//Since left != null, return left (Node 1).
//Final Result
//The k-th smallest node is Node 1, with a value of 1.

//Detailed Breakdown of count
//The code uses count to track the nodes visited in sorted order:
//Node 1: Increment count to 1 (matches k).
//No further traversal is needed after finding the k-th node.
//Why Does This Work?
//The code uses inorder traversal, which processes nodes in sorted order for BSTs.
//The if (count == k) condition ensures we stop traversal as soon as the desired element is found.
//The recursive structure ensures we return the k-th node back through the call stack.
